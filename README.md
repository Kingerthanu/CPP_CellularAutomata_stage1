# CPP_CellularAutomata_stage1
  Using OpenGL, this works as a project creating a 2d array of Cell* objects in which simulate state of a cell. Using the traditional game of life ruleset to turn on and off, this program will spark a small subset of the 260x260 2d array to "give life" to the simulation and start the reactions. This will go rouge and doesn't have a real way to terminate.

  I made this project as a knowledge check for myself in understanding OpenGL from my initial knowledge of the subject using my 3D worldspace engine in my previous repo. Gave me firmer understanding of buffer handling as well as shader handling.

  Very rough prog, I'm going to be slowly building upon a single file in order to build more elaborate cellular automata so am using this repo as a quick file dump.
